        <h3>Expression evaluation</h3>
        <p>
            An element attribute can be bound not only to a model variable,
            but to an expression consisting of model variables.
            The example below illustrates what kinds of operators may be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that you can define your custom function to refer to
            from the view expressions. It is possible to define such functions both
            as the fields of the controller as well as the fields of the model.
        <p>
            Unlike the event handlers, such controller field functions do <em>not</em> take
            the model and the context as their first parameters - the number and order of
            the parameters is the same as you would like to have in the view expression.
            See <code>myControllerFunction</code>  in the example below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Functions defined as controller fields, however, can't refer to the
            model variables. If you need your custom function to have access to
            the model variables, define it as a field of the model instead.
            See <code>myModelFunction</code> in the example below.
