        <h3>Controller mixins</h3>
        <p>
            Yellow code allows you to reuse controller code via the mixin concept.
            If multiple Yellow code controllers in your project contain the same
            methods (be it event handlers or custom functions), you may wish to
            factor the common pieces out into a separate object. Such an object
            is called a <em>mixin</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways how to make the mixin methods accessible to a Yellow code view:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Locally for a single view - when binding the view and the controller
                    via <code>$(...).yellowCode(...)</code>, instead of passing a single
                    controller to Yellow code, pass an array where the first element is
                    the controller and the remaining elements are one or more mixins:
                    <br/>
                    <code>$("#viewId").yellowCode([controller, mixin1, mixin2, ...]);</code>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Globally for the whole page - this will make the mixin automatically accessible
                    to all views:
                    <br/>
                    <code>$.yellowCode.standardMixins = [mixin1, mixin2, ...];</code>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The effect of making the mixins accessible to the view is the same as if you
            copy-pasted the methods of all the mixins and appended them to the existing methods
            of the controller.
        </p>
        <p>
            The example below also shows how to access the mixin methods from the controller.
            The <code>context</code> object contains a field called <code>controllerMethods</code>,
            which is an object with all the methods defined in any of the mixins made accessible
            (locally or globally).
