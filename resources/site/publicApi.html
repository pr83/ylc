        <h3>Public API</h3>
        <p>
            Alternatively, instead of using an adapter, you can use so called
            <em>public API</em> to access a controller method from outside the controller.
            The only difference between an adapter and
            a public API is that adapter exposes every single controller
            method to the outside world, whereas public API only exposes
            those controller methods which are marked as a part of the
            public API in the controller. To mark a controller method
            as a part of the public API, use the <code>@PublicApi</code>
            annotation. Instead of defining the method as a field of
            the controller, define a controller field called <code>"@PublicApi"</code>
            instead and put all publicly accessible methods as its fields,
            as the following example demonstrates.

        <p>
            As you can see, to get the public API proxy object, call<br/>
            <code>$(<em>your_view_selector</em>).yellowCode("getPublicApi")</code>
            passing the root element of the view <strong>after</strong> the
            Yellow code plugin was initialized on that element by passing it
            the controller.
