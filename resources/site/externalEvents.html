        <h3>Accessing controller from outside</h3>
        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/external_events.html">

        <p>
            Sometimes it's useful to read or update the model upon an event
            which is not triggered by any Yellow code view element.
            For example, if only a fraction of your page uses Yellow
            code and the rest uses conventional jQuery or plain JavaScript,
            it's useful if the parts outside the Yellow code controller can
            somehow read and/or manipulate the model and refresh the
            view accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            To invoke a controller method from outside the controller, first get so called
            <em>model adapter</em>.
            Model adapter is a JavaScript object which for every controller method
            contains exactly one method with the same name as the controller method.
            The adapter method, however, doesn't take the two parameters that every controller
            method gets - neither <code>model</code> nor <code>context</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example: If the controller contains methods<br/>
            <code>myMethod1(model, context, additionalArg1, additionalArg2)</code> and<br/>
            <code>myMethod2(model, context, additionalArg1)</code>, the
            controller adapter object will contain methods<br/>
            <code>myMethod1(additionalArg1, additionalArg2)</code> and<br/>
            <code>myMethod2(additionalArg1)</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you call the adapter method, Yellow code will call the corresponding
            controller method on your behalf, passing it the up-to-date model
            and the context object. After the controller method finishes, Yellow code
            will automatically redraw the view and apply all the changes the
            controller method did to the model.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the controller method returns a value, this value will be also returned
            by the corresponding adapter method.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get the adapter object, call<br/>
            <code>$(<em>your_view_selector</em>).yellowCode("getAdapter")</code>
            passing the root element of the view <strong>after</strong> the
            Yellow code plugin was initialized on that element by passing it
            the controller.
