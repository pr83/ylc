        <h3>Localization</h3>
        <p>
            In the Yellow code view you can use the following syntax to define a localizable
            text:
            <code>@{{key, arg0, arg1, arg2, ...}}</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Parameter <code>key</code> is the key of the localized message (without quotes),
            the additional arguments are the expressions which will be evaluated by Yellow code
            and passed to the translation function.
            Any valid expression which can be used in <code>data-ylcBind</code> mapping
            or in <code>{{...}}</code> is also valid here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example:
            <code>@{{key.of.localizable.message, 55, modelObject.field1 + modelObject.field2, 'cool'}}</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yellow code itself doesn't define the translation function. For the localizable strings
            to work, the controller has to define a function called
            <code>translate</code>, which takes the message key as its first parameter
            and the values of the expressions (after evaluation) as its additional parameters.
            Typically, the <code>translate</code> function will be placed to the global
            mixing so that it's available to all views.
        </p>
        <p>
            The example below shows a "poor man's" <code>translate</code> function
            implementation. For production consider using some mature library such
            as <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/yahoo/intl-messageformat">intl-messageformat</a>.
            In essence it is very straightforward to integrate any localization library
            with Yellow code: simply define a global mixin with the <code>translate</code>
            method which will pass its arguments to your chosen localization library
            and return the result.
