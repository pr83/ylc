        <h3>Using a jQuery plugin from within the view</h3>
        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/jquery_within_ylc.html">
        </div>
        <p>
            The above example shows how to install the
            <code>datepicker</code> jQuery plugin
            as soon as a (potentially dynamic) view element becomes visible.
            First, mark the element with the following attribute:<br/>
            <code>data-ylcElementInit="<em>controller_method</em>"</code>.
            <br/>
            The controller method specified as the value of the
            <code>data-ylcElementInit</code> attribute will be called
            just when the view element is
            initialized. For static elements this happens after installing
            the Yellow code plugin, for dynamic elements (elements within
            loops and conditional elements) this happens when they are added
            to the view and become visible. Replace <code><em>controller_method</em></code>
            with the name of the controller method which will install your desired
            jQuery plugin. To install the plugin the controller method needs the DOM
            element. It will get it through the context object (passed to it as its
            second parameter):
            <code>context.domElement</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also note that the controller method in the above example makes
            use of asynchronous events to react to an event which is triggered
            by the <code>datepicker</code> plugin.
        </p>

        <h4>Install plugin after element children are initialized</h4>
        
        <p>
            In the above example we used the <code>datepicker</code> plugin, which is very simple in a sense that it
            operates on a single <code>input</code> element (which has no children).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the example below we are trying to use a much more complex plugin &ndash; DataTables. The DataTables
            plugin operates not only on a single HTML element, but on a whole tree of HTML elements with
            <code>table</code> at the root and elements such as <code>tr</code>, <code>th</code> or <code>td</code>
            as its children.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you run the example, in the left half of the window you will see that using
            <code>data-ylcElementInit</code> doesn't work. The reason is that the handler for
            <code>data-ylcElementInit</code> is called after the
            <code>table</code> element is processed by YLC, but before the loop inside was processed and the child
            elements (<code>tr</code>, <code>td</code>, etc.) have been inserted to the DOM. DataTables expects all the
            HTML for the table to be present before it is installed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It can be fixed by using <code>data-ylcChildrenInit</code> instead. The handler for
            <code>data-ylcChildrenInit</code> is invoked just after the root <code>table</code> element
            <em>and</em> all its children have been processed by YLC. That is just in time for DataTables
            to see all the elements it needs. The result can be seen in the right half of the example window.
        </p>
        
        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/jquery_within_ylc_after_children_added.html">
        </div>

        
        <h4>Install plugin after element data are available</h4>
        
        <p>
            Sometimes installing the plugin as soon as the root element and its children are initialized is too early.
            This can happen for example when the data to be shown in the table is retrieved asynchronously using an AJAX
            call. In the example below we simulate an AJAX request using the <code>setTimeout</code> function. The data
            for the table is available roughly 100&nbsp;ms after YLC is installed. If you run the example, in the left
            half of the window you will see that installing DataTables in the handler of the
            <code>data-ylcChildrenInit</code> attribute doesn't work, because by the time the data has become available,
            the DataTables plugin has been already installed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It can be fixed by using the <code>data-ylcDomChanged</code> attribute instead. The handler specified in
            this attribute is called when the DOM subtree whose root is the element with <code>data-ylcDomChanged</code>
            is somehow modified &ndash; when elements are added to it, removed from it or when the
            attribute or text values are changed. In our example, the DOM subtree with the <code>table</code> element
            as root is not changed when we install YLC, because it only references the <code>rows</code> model variable,
            which is empty. When the data becomes available and we call <code>context.updateModel</code>, the DOM
            subtree is modified, therefore the <code>data-ylcDomChanged</code> handler is called; but now the
            <code>table</code> element contains all the data and it's safe to install DataTables. You can see the result
            in the right half of the window.
        </p>

        <h4>Re-install plugin after element data change (DOM flashing)</h4>
        
        <p>
            The above example works fine, but it has a serious flaw &ndash; if the data in the <code>rows</code> model
            variable changes again, Yellow code all of a sudden stops working, as demonstrated in the example below.
            First, a function wrapped in a <code>setTimeout</code> call modifies the <code>rows</code> model variable
            and adds some elements to it. So far so good. But try clicking the Add More button. The <code>click</code>
            event handler adds a couple of more elements, but they do not appear in the table.
        </p>

        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/jquery_within_ylc_reinstall_wrong.html">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            If you inspect the browser console, you will notice a nasty JavaScript error. The reason for that is that
            once the DataTables plugin is installed, it hijacks the part of the DOM corresponding to the table and
            makes changes to it which Yellow code can't handle.
        </p>

        <p>
            To fix this issue, Yellow code implements a mechanism called <em>DOM flashing</em>. DOM flashing essentially
            means that if there is a plugin installed in a part of the DOM and this part of the DOM is also managed by
            Yellow code, whenever we need to update that part of the DOM, we need to tell Yellow code to remove that
            part of the DOM, re-insert it exactly as it was when the page loaded, re-apply any changes in the model
            and re-install the given jQuery plugin. See the example below.
        </p>
        
        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/jquery_within_ylc_reinstall_correct.html">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            The example differs from the previous one at two places. First, the <code>table</code> element to which we
            would like to install DataTables is wrapped in a <code>div</code> with an attribute
            <code>data-ylcFlashId="myDataTable"</code>. This attributes tells Yellow code to only make a view-to-model
            synchronization once on that <code>div</code>. Once Yellow code processes the <code>div</code>, it ignores
            it from that point on (so even if we install an incompatible plugin to it, Yellow code will not crash).
            The only way how to update the table if the <code>rows</code> model variable is
            changed is to explicitly tell Yellow code to perform the flash operation on it. That's done by calling
            <code>context.flash("myDataTable");</code> The attribute passed to <code>context.flash</code> must have
            the same value as the attribute <code>data-ylcFlashId</code> of the wrapping <code>div</code>, but other
            than that the value can be arbitrary, but unique withing the view.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now clicking Add More works fine, but bear in mind that under the hood the whole table is removed from
            the DOM and re-inserted.
        </p>

        <p>
            To flash multiple DOM elements, simply pass multiple parameters (flash IDs), e.g.
            <code>context.flash("myDataTable1", "myDataTable2")</code>.
        </p>

        <h4>Preserving plugin state after DOM flashing</h4>

        <p>
            As mentioned in the previous paragraph, upon flashing the <code>table</code> element, the table is removed
            and re-initialized. One of the consequences is that the DataTables plugin installed to the table loses its
            state. Try the previous example and change the page to 2 or 3. Then click the Add More button.
            What happens? New records are inserted, but the current page is reverted to 1.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The proper solution of this problem requires a knowledge of the plugin used, in this case DataTables. The
            basic idea is to save the current page in the Yellow code model whenever the page changes; later, when the
            <code>table</code> element is re-initialized and we install the plugin, use the DataTables API to set the
            current page to the value remembered in the model.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            DataTables allows us to listen to the page change event using the API method
            <code>.on("page", function() {...})</code>. The page can then be changed by calling its API method
            <code>.page(...).draw("page")</code>. See the end result below.
        </p>
