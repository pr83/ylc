        <h3>On event only synchronize</h3>
        <p>
            Normally the changes in the view are propagated to the model just before
            the event handler is run and the changes in the model are propagated to the
            view just after the handler is run.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yellow code permits a special syntax of the <code>data-ylcEvents</code>
            attribute to specify that upon a certain event only the view-to-model
            and model-to-view synchronization should be done, but no actual event handler
            should be called - to the left of the colon specify the name of the event as
            usual, but leave the right hand side empty, e.g.:<br/>
            <code>data-ylcEvents="click:"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The example below demonstrates what it might be useful for. We have a model
            variable <code>n</code> which represents a number the user entered. We would
            like to show the square of this number and update the square as soon as the
            user enters a different number. We detect user entering a number by listening
            to the <code>keyup</code> event. We could define a handler for that event, but
            it is easier to just bind the <code>n*n</code> expression with the
            text of the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> where the square is supposed to be shown
            and tell Yellow code to synchronize the view with the model upon the <code>keyup</code>
            event.
