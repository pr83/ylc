        <h3>Basic Example</h3>

        This is an example of a simple page using Yellow code:
        
        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/basic_example.html">
        </div>

        <h4 id="basicExample_controller">Controller</h4>
        <p>
            All the model manipulation is done from within
            the <em>controller</em>. The controller is a plain JavaScript
            object which consists of methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>init</code> method is called automatically when the
            plugin initializes. Its task is to initialize the model.
            It takes the model as its first parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other methods are event handlers. They are called when an
            event is triggered. Their task is to update the model accordingly.
            The event handlers also take the model as their first parameter.
        </p>

        <h4 id="basicExample_events">Events</h4>
        
        <p>
            To specify the event handler, add an attribute called
            <code>data-ylcEvents</code> to the element which triggers
            the event.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To the left of the colon specify the <em>event name</em>.
                The event name is the same as used by jQuery.
                That means that you can even specify your own event, such as
                <code>data-ylcEvents="myEvent:&nbsp;myHandler"</code>
                and trigger it via jQuery:
                <code>$("myElement").trigger("myEvent")</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                To the right of the colon specify the <em>event handler</em>. That is just
                the name of the controller object property which contains
                the handler function.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        You can specify more event mappings, simply separate them
        by semicolon:
        <code>data-ylcEvents="event1: handler1; event2: handler2"</code>
        </p>

        <h4 id="basicExample_attributes">Mapping of model variables onto view elements</h4>
        <p>
            To bind a piece of HTML text to a model variable, put the following piece of
            code in place of the HTML text: <code>{{<em>modelVariableExpression</em>}}</code>.
            The <em>modelVariableExpression</em> bit is an expression defining the model variable
            (see <a href="expressionEvaluation.html">expression&nbsp;evaluation</a> for details).
        </p>
        <p>
            This syntax can also be used to specify a binding of an HTML element attribute onto
            a model variable, e.g.:<br/>
            <code>&lt;p&nbsp;class="{{classToUse}}"&gt;hello&lt;p&gt;</code><br/>
            as in the following example:
        </p>
        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/attributes_mapping.html">
        </div>

        <p>
            Not all attributes can be specified this way though. If you try and specify
            for example a <code>src</code> attribute of an <code>img</code> element
            as <code>{{myUrl}}</code>, the browser will try to load the image from the URL
            <code>"{{myUrl}}"</code> before Yellow code gets a change to replace
            <code>{{myUrl}}</code> with the actual value of the variable <code>myUrl</code>.
            Even though this has no effect on the user experience, it will result in a useless
            HTTP request to a non-existing (and nonsensical) URL.
        </p>

        <p>
            A similar problem will arise with the <code>css</code> attribute, because some
            browsers will try to parse it as a CSS definition
            before Yellow code gets a chance to preprocess it.
        </p>

        <p>
            In all such cases, you can always use a more generic method of attributes binding:
            to specify a mapping of an element attribute onto a model
            variable, add an attribute called <code>data-ylcBind</code>
            to the element.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To the left of the colon specify the <em>attribute name</em>.
                The attribute name is the same as the name of the jQuery
                getter/setter for that attribute. So to map the inner text
                of the element, use <code>text</code>, to manipulate the
                value of an input field, use <code>val</code>, etc.
                For some attributes jQuery uses getters/setters with a fairly
                generic name and the the first argument of the
                getter/setter further specifies the exact attribute to change.
                (As an example take
                <code><a href="http://api.jquery.com/css/" target="_blank">css</a></code>
                or
                <code><a href="http://api.jquery.com/attr/" target="_blank">attr</a></code>.)
                In Yellow code such attributes are defined using a dot notation:
                to the left of the dot is the getter/setter name and to the
                right there is the first argument passed to the getter/setter.
                So for example if your model contains a variable called
                <code>color</code> and you wish to map it to a paragraph color,
                your mapping will look like this:
                <code>
                    data-ylcBind="css.color:&nbsp;color"
                </code>.
                <br />
                If you create a jQuery plugin which follows the standard jQuery
                getter/setter convention, you can refer to the associated property
                from the Yellow code bindings:
                <code>data-ylcBind="myProperty: myModelVariable"</code>. This means
                that you can easily extend Yellow code simply by extending jQuery.
            </li>
            <li>
                To the right of the colon is the model variable name.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong>
            You can format the definition inside the <code>data-ylcBind</code> attribute
            making use of whitespace and C-style comments:
        </p>

        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/whitespace.html">
        </div>

        <h4 id="basicExample_loops">Loops</h4>
        <p>
            Yellow code allows you to generate some of the DOM elements
            dynamically. In the example above the model contains an array
            and we want to have one <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
            element (with children) for each array element.
        </p>
        <p>
            To specify that an element should be generated for each model
            array element, add an attribute
            <code>data-ylcLoop="element,status:&nbsp;list"</code>
            to the corresponding view element. The <code>status</code>
            variable is optional, you don't have to specify it:
            <code>data-ylcLoop="element:&nbsp;list"</code>.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>list</code></dt>
            <dd>
                Replace this with the name of the model variable which
                represents the array to iterate through.
            </dd>

            <dt><code>element</code></dt>
            <dd>
                Replace this with the name of the variable which will refer
                to the current element. This is <em>not</em> the model
                variable, but it can be used anywhere where a model variable
                would be used (such as in the <code>data-ylcBind</code> binding).
                The variable is writable - changing it will change the corresponding
                array element.
            </dd>

            <dt><code>status</code></dt>
            <dd>
                Replace this with the name of the variable which will refer
                to the current iteration status. This is <em>not</em> the model
                variable, but it can be used anywhere where a model variable
                would be used (such as in the <code>data-ylcBind</code> binding).
                The variable is read-only. It encapsulates the iteration index,
                which can be accessed like this: <code>status.index</code>.
                <br/>
                Also note that the status variable is accessible from within
                the controller method. The second parameter passed to the controller
                method is the <em>context</em>, which contains a field called
                <code>loopStatuses</code>. Because our status variable defined
                in the view is called <code>status</code>, we can access the status object
                like this: <code>context.loopStatuses.status</code>. The value of the status
                object will be the iteration status valid for the element which triggered
                the event. Note that <code>context.loopStatuses</code> may contain
                multiple status objects - this will happen if you have a nested loop
                in your view and both the parent and the child loop define a status
                variable.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            Once you have your view and controller ready, initialize
            the plugin by calling:<br/>
            <code>$("<em>your_view_selector</em>").yellowCode(controller);</code>.<br/>
        </p>
