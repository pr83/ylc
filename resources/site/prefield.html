            Some input fields on the page are often automatically pre-populated by the browser
            when the page loads (username and password being the typical examples).
            When using Yellow code, you may sometime notice that these pre-populated
            fields are deleted immediately after Yellow code initializes the view.
            See the below example "Wrong" section:
        </p>
        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/prefield.html">
        </div>
        <p>
            The reason is that after the controller <code>init</code> method is
            called, Yellow code updates the view according to what has been set
            in the model by <code>init</code>. If <code>init</code> sets a model
            variable to some value and that model variable is referenced from
            such a browser-populated input field, the browser-populated value
            will be overwritten by the model value. Similarly, if <code>init</code>
            doesn't set that model variable at all, the browser-populated field
            will be effectively erased.
        </p>
        <p>
            To overcome this problem, Yellow code introduces the concept called
            <em>prefields</em> (a pun on "pre-filled" and "field"). In the example
            in the "Correct" section you can see that <code>init</code> sets
            the model variable to <code>context.PREFIELD</code>. The effect is
            that after <code>init</code> is called and Yellow code updates
            the view according to the model for the first time, the model variables
            with value <code>context.PREFIELD</code> will be ignored and their
            corresponding view fields will be left intact. From that point on,
            however, the field will be treated as usual: When an event occurs
            and Yellow code will need to update the model according to the view
            (before passing control to the controller event handler), it will copy
            the field value (which might still have the same browser-populated value
            or it might have been changed by the user) to the model. After the event handler
            finishes, the value of the corresponding model variable will be copied
            over to the view again. So basically it's a normal bidirectional mapping,
            the only difference being that no model-to-view synchronization is done
            immediately after <code>init</code> is called.
