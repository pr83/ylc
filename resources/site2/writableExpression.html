            This example shows that the value of the view element attribute
            may be not only computed from an expression, but that the value
            may also be assigned to that expression. If the values of the
            above input fields are changed, their values will be assigned
            to the corresponding expressions. Not all expressions are
            assignable. One may write a value to the expression
            <code>persons[0].name</code>, but not to
            <code>"Mrs. " + persons[0].name + " " + persons[0].surname</code>.
