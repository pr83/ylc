        <h3>Using a jQuery plugin from within the view</h3>
        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/jquery_within_ylc.html">
        </div>
        <p>
            The above example shows how to install the
            <code>datepicker</code> jQuery plugin
            as soon as a (potentially dynamic) view element becomes visible.
            First, mark the element with the following attribute:<br/>
            <code>data-ylcEvents="ylcElementInitialized: <em>controller_method</em>"</code>.
            <br/>
            The <code>ylcElementInitialized</code> is a special Yellow code
            event which will be triggered just when the view element is
            initialized. For static element this happens after installing
            the Yellow code plugin, for dynamic elements (elements within
            loops and conditional elements) this happens when they are added
            to the view and become visible. Replace <code><em>controller_method</em></code>
            with the name of the controller method which will install your desired
            jQuery plugin. To install the plugin the controller method needs the DOM
            element. It will get it through the context object (passed to it as its
            second parameter):
            <code>context.domElement</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also note that the controller method in the above example makes
            use of asynchronous events to react to an event which is triggered
            by the <code>datepicker</code> plugin.
