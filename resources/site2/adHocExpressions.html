        <h3>Ad hoc expressions</h3>
        <p>
            Yellow code normally reports an error if an expression in the <code>data-ylcBind</code>
            references a non-existing variable/field. This is to prevent errors caused by typos.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the expression <code>data-ylcBind="val: addresses[1].postcode"</code>.
            If the model doesn't contain any variable called <code>addresses</code>,
            Yellow code will complain:<br/>
            <code>Error: Left hand side of the '[]' operator must not be null/undefined.</code><br/>
            If, on the other hand, <code>addresses[1]</code> evaluates to <code>null</code>
            or <code>undefined</code>, Yellow code will complain:<br/>
            <code>Error: Left hand side of the '.' operator must not be null/undefined.</code><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes, however, it might be quite tedious to initialize the data structure
            representing the model data, especially if it's supposed to contain nested
            objects. Luckily, you can use a feature called <em>ad-hoc expression evaluation</em>,
            which allows you to ignore <code>null</code>/<code>undefined</code> objects
            when reading the data from the model and even create these objects on the fly
            when writing to the model.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>ad-hoc</em> object reference operator, <code>#</code>, can be used any time
            when a standard reference operator (the dot) would be used. The difference is that
            if we read from the model and the left hand side of <code>#</code>is
            <code>null</code>/<code>undefined</code>, the result will be
            <code>null</code>/<code>undefined</code> and no error will be thrown. Moreover, if we
            write to the model, the variable on the left hand side of <code>#</code> will be
            created (initialized to an empty object <code>{}</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>ad-hoc</em> array reference operator, <code>@</code>, can be used any time
            when a standard reference operator (square brackets) would be used. The difference is that
            if we read from the model and the left hand side of <code>@</code>is
            <code>null</code>/<code>undefined</code>, the result will be
            <code>null</code>/<code>undefined</code> and no error will be thrown. Moreover, if we
            write to the model, the variable on the left hand side of <code>@</code> will be
            created (initialized to an empty array <code>[]</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the <em>null coalescing operator</em> is used to specify a default value
            of a primitive data type (string, number). The syntax is
            <code>modelExpression ||| defaultValue</code>. If <code>modelExpression</code>
            evaluates to <code>null</code>/<code>undefined</code>, the result of reading
            this expression will be <code>defaultValue</code> and no error will be thrown.
            The expression is writable (L-value); writing to it has the same effect as writing
            to <code>modelExpression</code> directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the example below, there's no <code>init</code> method to create the model
            data structure. Yet, the data structure is automatically initialized as soon as it's
            needed by the <code>print</code> event handler.
