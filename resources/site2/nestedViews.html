        <h3>Example: Nested views</h3>
        <p>
            The following example demonstrates that a Yellow code view can be nested
            inside another Yellow code view and each view can have its own model
            and controller.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first view is a simple color picker. It is actually wrapped inside
            a simple jQuery plugin called <code>colorWidget</code>. This plugin
            transforms a DIV it is applied to into a colored rectangle which, when clicked,
            opens a color picker and when the user selects a color in the color picker,
            the color of the rectangle is changed and the picker is closed. The plugin
            further defines a jQuery-style getter/setter to read/change the current
            color programmatically:
        <ul>
            <li><code>$(...).colorWidget("color")</code> to read the current color,</li>
            <li><code>$(...).colorWidget("color", "green")</code> to change the current color.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since Yellow code understands the jQuery getter/setter convention, the color of the
            rectangle can be bound to the model like this:
            <code>&lt;div data-ylcBind="colorWidget.color: color"&gt;</code>
            This binding is defined by the outer Yellow code view. The outer view
            simply defines a couple of rectangles in various colors. The colorful
            rectangles are DIVs onto which the <code>colorWidget</code> has been
            applied as soon as the DIVs became initialized.
