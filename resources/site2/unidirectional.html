        <h3>Unidirectional mappings</h3>
        <p>
            Try to run the following example and type something to the "Name" field:
        </p>
        <div class="jqExample" data-sourceUrl="examples/unidirectional.html">
        </div>
        <p>
            Did you notice that you were unable to enter anything to the field
            in the section labeled "Wrong"? Whenever you typed something,
            the contents of the text field was deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The trouble is that below the input fields we have a paragraph of text
            which also contains a binding to the model variable <code>name</code>:<br/>
            <code>data-ylcBind="text: person1.name"</code>.
            So when Yellow code synchronizes the changes in the view into the model,
            it first encounters the text field, picks the text you have just typed in
            and changes the model variable <code>name</code>, but in a while it encounters
            the text paragraph, it picks the text it contains (which is an empty string)
            and changes the model variable <code>name</code> again - to an empty string!
        </p>
        <p>
            What we <em>really</em> want Yellow code to do is to change the text paragraph
            to what the model contains, but do not change the model to what the paragraph
            contains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily this is pretty easy to do. In the section labeled "Correct"
            we have the same input field and the same paragraph as in the
            section labeled "Wrong"; the only difference is that the bindings now
            contain the "arrow" symbols <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;-</code>
            between the attribute name and the binding expression, instead of the
            colon. Whereas the colon specifies a 2-way binding, the arrows
            define a unidirectional mapping: either a "view-to-model-mapping"
            (<code>-&gt;</code>) or a "model-to-view-mapping" (<code>&lt;-</code>).
            For the input field we only need to propagate the change in the view
            (user typing something) to the model. For the paragraph text we only
            need to propagate the change in the model to the view.
