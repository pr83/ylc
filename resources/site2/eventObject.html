        <h3>Event object and event handler return value</h3>
        <p>
            The JavaScript event object is accessible to the controller event handler under
            <code>context.eventObject</code> (where <code>context</code> is the second parameter
            of the controller method).
        </p>
        <p>
            The event handler can return <code>false</code> to indicate that a default action
            should be suppressed and that the event should not bubble up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both the event object and the return value are demonstrated in the following example;
            the event object is used to get the coordinates of where the user clicked within
            the clickable area. The handler returns <code>false</code> to suppress redirecting
            the user to the URL specified by <code>href</code>:
